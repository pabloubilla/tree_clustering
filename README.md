# Tree Species Clustering for determining Functional Groups

This repository contains the code and data for my dissertation at the UCL MSc Ecology and Data Science. The project aims to cluster tree species to determine functional groups and identify how many types of trees there are based on traits.

For any inquiries, please feel free to contact me (pabloubilla at ug.uchile.cl).
