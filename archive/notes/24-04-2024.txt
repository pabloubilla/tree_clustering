How to proceed with clustering?
1. Decide set of traits to use (based on previous paper or other metric).
2. Use Gaussian Mixture Model, it could be for:
    2.1 Inputed data (based on phy or other method)
    2.2 Incomplete data
3. Try different parameters for Mixture Models. Use evaluation metrics (AIC, BIC, Silhoutte)
4. With the GMM we will output a mean vector and covariance matrix for each cluster. Some things we could show/study:
    - For each species we will have both, the probability that it belongs to cluster k and its density f_k if it was
    part of cluster k. We calculate some sort of p-values for outlier identification. 
    - It'd be interesting to study those points that have very low density (or p-val) in its selected cluster
    - If we compute this p-values, we could see how well they adjust to a Uniform distribution. I feel like this
    could have some insights related to Neutral Theory (or might also be related to just errors in the data)
    - I guess Neutral Theory would kind of assume that there is only one cluster (I'm not sure if necessarily 
    Normally distributed). We could compare this one cluster model to our K cluster model obtained with the GMM
    - I feel like it would probably be better if we selected only one K for most of the results, but it might be 
    worth showing results for various K (in the line of: how would the world look if it was like this?)


Other questions:
- Is the data missing at random?


Maybe:
    - Bootstrapping traits to see consensus
